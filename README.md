# GeneticAlgorithm_Fitness

Implemented a prototype for a genetic algorithm for a population with N individuals. At the application level, create and display a Population, each time the user pushes the Do a Generation Button, the following actions are executed:

- evaluateFitness()
- selectMatingPool()
- applyGeneticOperators()
- replacement()

Experimented with different parameter settings including mutation and crossover and different fitness functions to determine combinations that lead to efficiently optimizing the various functions.
